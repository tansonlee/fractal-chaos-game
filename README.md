# Fractals with Chaos Game

### Fractal patterns are created using chaos game

Made with JavaScript and visualized with the p5.js library

Most general definition: <br>
There are fixed verticies which can be defined by the verticies of a shape, for example a triangle. One vertex is chosen as the starting point then another random vertex is chosen. The mid point is found between the two points and a dot is drawn there. This mid point becomes the new starting point and another vertex is chosen at random. The mid point is then found again and a dot is drawn. A pattern appears as these steps continue. Restrictions can be applied to create interesting fractals.

With 3 verticies a Serpinski Triangle forms: <br>
