# Fractals with Chaos Game

### Fractal patterns are created using chaos game

Made with JavaScript and visualized with the p5.js library

**Most general definition:** <br> There are fixed vertices which can be defined by the vertices of a shape, for example a triangle. One vertex is chosen as the starting point then another random vertex is chosen. The mid point is found between the two points and a dot is drawn there. This mid point becomes the new starting point and another vertex is chosen at random. The mid point is then found again and a dot is drawn. A pattern appears as these steps continue. Restrictions can be applied to create interesting fractals.

**With 3 vertices a Serpinski Triangle forms:** <br>

**Other results:** <br> When more restrictions are placed and more vertices are added other interesting results.

| Result | Restriction |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Four points are used as vertices and points cannot be placed within the central Nike logo. This creates a fractal pattern where points cannot exist within the smaller Nike logos creating a fractal patter of logos. | <img src="assets/region/nike.gif" width="300" align="left"> |
